# RIFT (Repository Interface For Terminals)
## By 0Stormy

**RIFT is currently being rewritten being I was really bad at coding when I started this**

RIFT is a new way of downloading files of the internet, it uses repositories that anyone can setup and host on a web server. RIFT runs right in your terminal so you can use it on Windows, Mac, and Linux with ease.

Don't like how something is written or there is a missing feature? RIFT is easily modifiable as you can easily add commands. You can also choose to submit a pull request on the Github if the feature useful enough.

You may also contribute locales! To contribute locales, copy and paste the English locale with a name equivelent to the language you want to work on if the locale isn't there already. Then you can just edit the text in the JSON file to the translated version.

**BY USING THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE, YOU MAY NOT PIRATE WITH IT, IF YOU DO PIRATE WITH IT YOU WILL NOT RECIEVE ANY SUPPORT OR BE ALLOWED TO CONTRIBUTE!**
